The datasets are a csv file (`Metrics.csv`) and a shapefile (`UFES.shp`) of polygons with attributes.

- `UFES.shp` attributes' are the following: FUA codes, country name, main city name, clusters and groups of FUAs resulting from the hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), the R color codes used in the article, the five UFES budget indexes as well as an aggregated global UFES index for each FUA.

- `Metrics.csv` contains the FUA codes, the land cover and landscape metrics used in the HCA.
